This repository contains 6 different juypeter notebooks for working with pixelwise resolved Mueller matrix data. 

Among these notebooks there are a variety of Mueller matrix decomposition functions as well as data visualization and further analysis which can be done from that point. 
Brief summaries of which are listed below-

Bulk_Lu_Chipman_Decomposition- performs a Lu Chipman decoposition or all named datasets in a given folder, returning pixelwise polarization properties of each wavelength of each dataset.

DOLP Calculation- Calculates the degree of linear polarization from the Mueller matrix parameters across all pixels in an image.

Find curvature from OCT- This notebook provides analysis and works with three dimensional datasets such as a three dimensional tiff file from an optical coherence tomography measurement to find the curvature of a tissue sample along a selected line.
